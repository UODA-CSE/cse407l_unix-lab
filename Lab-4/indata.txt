They can weigh up to 6,000 kg and live for up to 70 years in the wild. Elephants are found in various habitats, including forests, savannas and deserts. They have strong social bonds and live in family groups led by a matriarch. Elephants are considered to be a keystone species and play an important role in their ecosystem. They are listed as vulnerable by the IUCN with African elephants and Asian elephants being listed as separate subspecies.
